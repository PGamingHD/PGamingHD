# Hey there, I'm Pontus Karlsson! 👋

I'm a self taught [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and JavaScript developer from Sweden, currently studying to later in life hopefully become a System Engineer.

* ⚡Fun Fact: I actually taught myself how to program by taking on problems myself, learning from solving the issues I come along! Also some reasearching like I still do to this day, is the way to go. I also studied Game Development before I decided to go for System Engineering instead.
* 🤔 I have also worked with other languages before, but I would say I'm mainly familiar with `[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)`, `JavaScript`, `Kotlin`, `C#` & `Lua`.

# 📚 Experience 
I'm a self taught, backend developer, that first went into coding back in **2018** and fell in love with the language `JavaScript`. Since of **December of 2022** I switched my main language to be `TypeScript` which is also the language I use daily now.

# ✍ Key Notes
* Self taught, backend developer
* Started coding back in **2018**
* Over 4 years of experience with `JavaScript` and a couple of months with `[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)`.
* Always willing to learn new things, and ofcourse work in teams.
