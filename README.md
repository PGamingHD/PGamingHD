# Hey there, I'm Pontus Karlsson! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self taught `TypeScript` and JavaScript developer from Sweden, currently studying to later in life hopefully become a System Engineer.

* Fun Fact: I actually taught myself how to program by taking on problems myself, learning from solving the issues I come along! Also some reasearching like I still do to this day, is the way to go.
