# Hey there, I'm Pontus Karlsson! üëã

I'm a self taught [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and JavaScript developer from Sweden, currently studying to later in life hopefully become a System Engineer.

* ‚ö°Fun Fact: I actually taught myself how to program by taking on problems myself, learning from solving the issues I come along! Also some reasearching like I still do to this day, is the way to go. I also studied Game Development before I decided to go for System Engineering instead.
* ü§î I have also worked with other languages before, but I would say I'm mainly familiar with [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [`JavaScript`](https://www.javascript.com), [`Kotlin`](https://kotlinlang.org), [`C#`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) & [`Lua`](https://www.lua.org).

# üìö Experience 
I'm a self taught, backend developer, that first went into coding back in **2018** and fell in love with the language [`JavaScript`](https://www.javascript.com). Since of **December of 2022** I switched my main language to be [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org) which is also the language I use daily now.

# ‚úç Key Notes
* Self taught, backend developer
* Started coding back in **2018**
* Over 4 years of experience with [`JavaScript`](https://www.javascript.com) and a couple of months with [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
* Always willing to learn new things, and ofcourse work in teams.
